BridgePoint Plug-ins 

BridgePoint has been released as Open Source Software by Mentor Graphics.  This repository houses the eclipse plug-in source code.  

Please note that this repository is just a temporary home as the transition occurs.  As development and transition continues, we will re-home the source under the xtuml/bridgepoint repository.
